# Numerical-Methods

This repository contains code written from my second year Numerical Analysis class.

The contents of this repository are:
1. Numerical differentiation approximations using forwards difference, backwards as well as backwards difference
2. Numerical integeration approximations
3. Estimating roots of equations 
4. Eigenvalue pair estimations using power rule and inverse power rule
5. Interpolation methods
6. Least squares
